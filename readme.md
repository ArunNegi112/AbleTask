## What i am building? 

- A simple chatbot, with memory of previous chats. 
- user will give input: describing what he/she has to do
    - Consider example of learning oops, user will say something like 
    "I have to study oops in python, how much time should i give to it? _OR_ he can declare the amount of time he has to complete a task.  
    Based on that, model will divide that work and create checkpoints 

- The output should be minimal, in pointers etc.
